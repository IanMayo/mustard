To do this, travel within 2 km of the Survey Vessel (directly East of you). \nYou're going to have to press the Play ('>') button in the Time controls, you may also wish to use +/- buttons to speed up or slow down the time. \nYou will also have to steer to the correct course using the 'Demanded' course control (+5/-5)",
