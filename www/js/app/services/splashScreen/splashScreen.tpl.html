      <h3>SUBJECT: AN ASW CAPABILITY FOR THE FUTURE - ASW ‘90</h3>

      <p class="redacted-text">Petty Officer Jim Stoner,</p>

      <p>
        1. Overview: Following the near loss of the
        <span class="redacted-text"> Isle of Wright to Nergurial Forces</span>
        during Autumn 1981, Command In Chief Allied Forces
        <span class="redacted-text">mandate 4321/82 </span>
        directed the urgent development of a step-change in ASW capability.

        <br/><br/>
        2. <span class="redacted-text">CTF-568 </span>
        has been stood up to administer improvements to ASW equipments,
        technologies and skills sufficient to put the Allied ASW capability
        on a clear pillar of superiority - with the working title ASW ‘90.
        <br/><br/>

        3. SubTrack ‘90:  A significant part of the ASW ‘90 capability improvement
        will be the trials of a radical ASW platform
        <span class="redacted-text">carrying SkunkWorks sensors, equipments, and systems.</span>
        This platform has the working title SubTrack ‘90.
        <br/><br/>

        4. You are to present yourself to AF Brigand, 12 Berth, New Portsmouth by 14th September ready for ASW duties.
        <br/><br/>

        5. Structure: You are assigned exclusively to
        <span class="redacted-text">CTF-568</span> until satisfactory completion of the
        Phased development of new capabilities.  Each Phase will represent increased complexity/challenge,
        comprising a series of Missions to validate skillsets.
        You will only proceed to the next Mission on satisfactory completion of the previous one.
        After each Mission (successfully completed or not) you will be invited to perform Post Mission Review.
        Similarly, as an <span class="redacted-text">Investor in People, </span>
        CTF-568 will provide Remedial Guidance, plus <span class="redacted-text">
        Suspension Of Leave </span>as appropriate.
        <br/><br/>

        6. Following successful demonstration of Sound Room skills,
        you will be given elevated Ship Control responsibilities,
        with subsequent control of Advanced Ranging tools, plus Weapons-Free status for
        <span class="redacted-text">destruction of enemy forces, </span>subject to relaxed ROE.
        <br/><br/>

        7. Needless to say, the successful provision of ASW ‘90 is critical to the
        future defence of Allied Territories.
      </p>

      <p>Yours Aye</p>
