'center' Attribute Documentation
==================================

This sub-directive needs the **leaflet** main directive, so it is normaly used as an attribute of the *leaflet* tag, like this:

```
<leaflet center="center"></leaflet>
```

It will map an object _center_ of our controller scope with the corresponding object on our directive isolated scope. It's a bidirectional relationship, so a change in this object on the controller scope will affect the map center position, or an interaction on the map which changes the map center will update our _center_ values. Let's define the center model with an example:

```
$scope.center = {
    lat: 51.505,
    lng: -0.09,
    zoom: 4
}
```

We can see that a center is conformed by three attributes: _lat_, _lng_ and _zoom_. When we associate that object with our _leaflet-directive_ the bi-directional relation will start.


Let's see a complete example of how to use this. We must create a center object in our controller, pass its name to our directive _center_ attribute, an that's all.

```
angular.extend($scope, {
    center: {
        lat: 51.505,
        lng: -0.09,
        zoom: 4
    }
});
```

And after that, in our HTML code we will define our leaflet directive like this:
```
<leaflet center="center"></leaflet>
```

And that's all. A full example of using this attribute can be found [here](http://tombatossals.github.io/angular-leaflet-directive/examples/center-example.html).

Autodiscover
------------
The _lat_, _lng_, and _center_ properties are mandatory to make the center work, but we have an optional property which we can use to auto-discover the position of the user browsing our page using the [W3C Geolocation API](http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html) using the corresponding methods defined on the [Leaflet API](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#map-locate).

For example, we could show the user map position on start, or conditionally when he press a button. This property is defined like this:

```
angular.extend($scope, {
    center: {
        lat: 51.505,
        lng: -0.09,
        zoom: 4,
        autoDiscover: true
    }
});
```

We can see an example of how to use it [here](http://tombatossals.github.io/angular-leaflet-directive/examples/center-autodiscover-example.html).


Development information
-----------------------
Each change to our scope defined _center_ object will update the map, or viceversa. This is accomplished via an angularJS watcher, defined [here](https://github.com/tombatossals/angular-leaflet-directive/blob/v0.7.0/src/directives/center.js#L34) in our code. When we change our map center or zoom, our _center_ object will be updated, these events are defined [here](https://github.com/tombatossals/angular-leaflet-directive/blob/v0.7.0/src/directives/center.js#L47) in our code.
